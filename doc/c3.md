For validation we used the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 validators.

Validator information from [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/): 
> This validator checks the markup validity of Web documents in HTML, XHTML, SMIL, MathML, etc. If you wish to validate specific content such as RSS/Atom feeds or CSS stylesheets, MobileOK content, or to find broken links, there are other validators and tools available. As an alternative you can also try our non-DTD-based validator.
